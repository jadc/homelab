# homelab
The declarative NixOS configuration of my personal home lab.

## Installation
1. Place the SSH keys for your GitHub in `~/.ssh`
2. TODO

## Testing
To create a virtual machine with this configuration, simply run:

```sh 
nix run
```

Ensure your GitHub SSH keys are in `~/.ssh`, otherwise this command will fail.
